# C-Projects
C++ Programming Language
Various projects related to classes, linked lists, some algorithms 

1.) Doubly Linked List: C++ classes with separate header and CPP files to implement doubly linked list 
which performs all of the standard abstract data type (ADT) operations. We 
can insert and remove nodes, update nodes, clear the list, get its length, find if 
the list is empty, reverse the linked list and print the list. It also keeps track of if 
the user is accessing nodes out of bounds and throws exceptions in those cases. 
It contains various constructors for initialization and can easily be modified 
due to the proper use of modularity.
