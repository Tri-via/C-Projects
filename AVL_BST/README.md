(Binary Search Tree Iterators)
This has the implementation of the following functions:

insert : insert node as leaf
remove: remove node
clear: It clears the tree.
isBalanced: return balanced status according to avl.
print : print the tree
empty: tells if there atleast one node or not.
iterators: used for traversing.
internalFind: finds a node in the tree.
getSmallestNode : returns smallest node.
predecessor: returns just small element to the given element.
printRoot: print the bst tree.
nodeSwap: swaps 2 node.
deleteALl: empty the tree.
del: deletes a node and a helper for remove.
isBal: tells is current node is balanced

(AVL Trees)
This has the implementation of the following functions:
insert : used to insert a node.
remove: used to remove a node.
leftRotate: rotate the node in left direction.
rightRotate: rotate the node in right direction.
inserthelper: it is a recursive function which is called from insert.
predecessor: it gives the predecessor of the given node.
removehelper: it is a recursive funtion to delete a node.
getBalance: provide balance in terms of integer.
